# Text-To-Speech
Text-To-Speech Using Python with a interactive GUI
Just open **Protoype3.py** file with any Python **IDE**  and run the file and BOOM! you have successfully executed the TTS File.  
Now i have attached a original .ui file which i have made using software called **Qt Desginer**.  
  
Here's the link for the software:[Qt Designer](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)  
Install all the dependencies for the program to run which i have mentioned in the **requirements.txt** file.    
  
You can also convert the **.ui** file to **.py** file using command in cmd or terminal:  
```pyuic5 GUI.ui -o GUI.py```
